            First aiders will be available at the
            start/finish area in Battersea Park.
            In the event of a minor incident on
            the route, please seek assistance
            from a marshal or call event control.
            It may be quicker and easier to
            attend A&E yourself rather than
            returning to the finish area.
            The nearest Accident & Emergency
            (A&E) is St Thomasâ€™ Hospital,
            Westminster Bridge Road,
            London SE1 7EH.
            In an emergency, call 999 first!
